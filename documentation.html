<h3>What are CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-co2e-emissions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anthropogenic climate change is caused by greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxides (N<sub>2O</sub>) and others. The molecules of these gases contribute differently to global warming. For example, the impact of one methane molecule is 21 times higher than the impact caused by one carbon dioxide molecule (<a class="reference external" href="https://animres.edpsciences.org/articles/animres/abs/2000/03/z0305/z0305.html">Moss et al. 2000</a>). This is why the impact of different greenhouse gases is usually converted to the equivalent impact that carbon dioxide molecules would have, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub>e equivalents as a standard unit (<a class="reference external" href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.103">Gohar &amp; Shine 2007</a>). The basic formula for a consumption value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> and an emission factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> is:</p>

<h3>Emission factor sources and uncertainties<a class="headerlink" href="#emission-factor-sources-and-uncertainties" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>

</ul>
<p>The specific emission factors for different activities are collected in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pledge4future/co2calculator/blob/main/data/emission_factors.csv">this emission factor table</a>.</p>
<p>Several data sources for emission factors are available with differences in their level of detail (e.g. occupancy rates of vehicles, car sizes…), geographic resolution (e.g. national, sub-national…) and up-to-dateness with resulting implications for their within- and across-country comparability.
With the selected sources, we aim at providing reliable and user-friendly emission calculations that are comparable across countries, most recent and that come along with acceptable user efforts. When comparisons within countries or more detailed heating emission calculations are required, we suggest to rely on national sources and to provide custom emission factors as district heating can vary significantly across district heating networks within a country. Similarly, while emission factors for most public and private transport are globally comparable, those for electrically powered trams or trains vary significantly across countries.

<span id="id1"></span><h3>Compliance with the GHG Protocols<a class="headerlink" href="#compliance-with-the-ghg-protocols" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Standards provide a globally used framework to measure greenhouse gas emissions (<a class="reference external" href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">Greenhouse Gas Protocol 2024</a>). They account for three scopes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity, such as emissions from combustion in owned vehicles or boilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions caused by the generation of purchased or consumed electricity, heating, cooling or steam.</p></li>
<li><p>Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions other than those captured in scope 3. These include all other emissions generated in the life cycle of the product, including production and disposal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For electricity and mobility, the <em>co2calculator</em> computes emissions based on the whole life cycle of a product, i.e. including scope 3 emissions. For heating, scope 1 emissions are caculated.</p>

<h2>1 Electricity<a class="headerlink" href="#electricity" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Electricity CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions can either be calculated from country-specific production mixes or, when available, residual mixes (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/international_electricity_factors.html">Carbon Footprint 2023</a>). Production mixes are the mix of fuels used by local power stations and, therefore, the basis for location-based reporting. Residual mixes are electricity mixes after removing energy from specific (e.g. green or renewable) tariffs. These values can thus be used for emission accounting when the user has not bought energy from a specific mix of fuels. Emission factors rely on total or, respectively, residual production fuel mixes, which include scope 2 and scope 3 emissions of the GHG protocol (for details, see <a class="reference internal" href="#compliance-with-the-ghg-protocols">Compliance with the GHG Protocols</a>).
Alternatively, users can provide specific emission factors, for example, when they use green or renewable tariffs.</p>

<p>Mobility emissions depend on the mode of transport, such as car or bicycle, and the distance travelled in kilometers (km). This distance may either be directly provided, or it may be computed from given start and stop locations using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pledge4future/co2calculator/blob/main/co2calculator/distances.py">distances.py</a>.

<h3>Distance computation<a class="headerlink" href="#distance-computation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For cars and motorbikes, distances are computed with <a class="reference external" href="https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/directions">openrouteservice</a> with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">profile='driving-car'</span></code>.</p>
<p>For other modes of transport (airplane, ferry, train, bus), the distances between the locations as the crow flies are computed with the haversine formula.

With the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">roundtrip</span></code>-parameter (type: boolean), users can define if their trip is a roundtrip and if so, the distance will be doubled.</p>
<section id="detour">
<h4>Detour<a class="headerlink" href="#detour" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Trips on earth will always make a detour, because it is usually not possible to travel in a straight line from start to destination. Therefore, we use coefficients and constants to account for this detour. These differ depending on the mode of travel.</p>

<h2>4 Calculation of the carbon budget<a class="headerlink" href="#calculation-of-the-carbon-budget" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="the-carbon-budget">
<h3>The carbon budget<a class="headerlink" href="#the-carbon-budget" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>According to the IPCC (2021),</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“[the] term ‘carbon budget’ refers to the maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic $CO_2$ emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is referred to as the total carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining carbon budget when expressed from a recent specified date […]. The remaining carbon budget indicates how much CO2 could still be emitted while keeping warming below a specific temperature level”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">IPCC 2021, p. 28</a>)</p>
</section>
<section id="calculation-of-the-remaining-carbon-budget">
<h3>Calculation of the remaining carbon budget<a class="headerlink" href="#calculation-of-the-remaining-carbon-budget" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To calculate the remaining carbon budget, we followed an equal-per-capita approach. This means that the remaining global carbon budget is distributed equally among the world’s population. First, we divide the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that could still be emitted worldwide by the world population. For example, to reach the 1.5° goal, 300 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> could still be emitted. Taking into account that the population of the world is growing, we do not divide the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> by the current population of the world, but instead by the mean between the current population and the population projected for 2050. 2050 is when most of the countries plan to be carbon neutral. Finally, we divide the remaining carbon budget per person by the number of years left until carbon neutrality should be reached.</p>
<p>The calculation of the carbon budget is summed up in the following table. Since Germany has pledged to be carbon neutral already by 2045, the remaining time is shorter and therefore the remaining carbon budget per person and year is a bit higher. You can view this remaining carbon budget as the average amount of carbon that could still be emitted per year and person until 2050 (or, respectively for Germany, 2045).</p>
