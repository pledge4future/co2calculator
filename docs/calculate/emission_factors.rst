Emission factors
================

For computing emissions, a central piece of information is the emission intensity of the different activities.
These are expressed by emission factors.
Below, you can find a list of all activities and their emission factors (in co2e per unit).
Within one category, the emission intensity may differ drastically depending on the specification
Let's take a trip by car. A medium battery electric car emits around 0.056 kg co2e/km (including emissions from
manufacturing), while an average car driving on gasoline emits 0.224 kg co2e/km.
