# CO<sub>2</sub>Calculator

[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

Python package to calculate work related CO2 emissions from heating and electricity consumption as well as business trips and commuting.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Description

This package is part of [Pledge4Future](https://pledge4future.org/), a project to quantify, monitor and reduce work-related emissions collectively and sustainably. 

## :computer:  Installation

### With pip (recommended)

PyPi release coming soon!

<!--The recommended way to install this package is with pip from the Python Package Index ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/)):

```
pip install -U co2calculator
```-->

### From source

To install this package from source, clone the repository as usual, for example with:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/pledge4future/co2calculator.git
cd co2calculator
```

This package requires Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 and can be installed using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). You can install it in your (virtual) environment with:

```
$ pip install -U poetry
$ poetry install --no-root
```


## ‚å®  How to Use

Learn how to use `co2calculator` in our detailed [documentation](https://github.com/pledge4future/co2calculator/blob/dev/docs/documentation.md). [...]

The CO<sub>2</sub> Calculator uses the [OpenRouteService (ORS) API](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs) to obtain distances between the locations provided by the user to calculate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of business trips. This requires an API key, which is read from an `.env` file.

### Create an ORS API key and save it in your .env file

1) Go to https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup and create an account (or sign up with GitHub).
2) In the Dev dashboard, switch to the tab `TOKENS` and request a free token.
3) Once you have the key, click on it to copy it to clipboard.
4) Insert the key into [sample.env](sample.env) and rename the file to `.env`.

## :couple:  Contribution guidelines

If you want to contribute to this project, please fork this repository and create a pull request with your suggested changes.


### Install pre-commit hooks

To ensure coding style we use pre-commit hooks. Install them locally using

```
$ pre-commit install
```

They will be run automatically every time you try to create a commit. `black` will adapt the code automatically to
conform to PEP8 code style. After this has been done you may need to add the file again to the staging area.

### Run tests

After you have made changes to the code, run the units tests by executing

```
$ pytest
```
