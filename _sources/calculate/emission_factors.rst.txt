Emission factors
================

For computing emissions, a central piece of information is the emission intensity of the different activities.
These are expressed by emission factors.
Below, you can find lists of all activities and their emission factors (in co2e per unit).
Within one category, the emission intensity may differ drastically depending on the specification.
